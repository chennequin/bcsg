What I understand about the webApp:
- show cards (pagination?) with specific order
- add card (manually)
- add cards (csv)
- only store data for the duration of the user's session (I would like to ask question about this, is this a business requirement or a way to keep the webApp simple for the demonstration)

Specified requirements:
- Java 7
- maven

I add the following:
- responsive design

SPRING Framework allows to implements all layers of the application in a very clean way, allowing tests, etc.
Bootstrap is a must for responsive design and have good looking components.

There is still a lot of things to do (but I've spend much more time than the two hours required, and basic requirements are met):
TODO LIST:
- nice formatter for card number
- pagination
- more tests (units tests an integration tests) validating at least basic requirements (ordering, -xxxx replacements)
- control over validation messages
- internationalization (on my computer validation messages are in French, others part of the webApp are in English)
- add logs
- be aware of encoding of CSV files (problem could arise for bank with special names: "Société Générale")
- page rendering (html/css) is still perfectible
